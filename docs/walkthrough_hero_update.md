# Walkthrough - Hero Section Update

I have updated the Hero Section of the Avetti Channel Connect application to align with your request.

## Changes Made

1.  **Title & Subtext Update**:
    *   **Title**: Changed to **"Avetti Channel Connect"**.
    *   **Subtext**: Updated to **"Connect your Shopify / Shopify Plus Store with External Suppliers and Wholesalers. Seamlessly integrate your ecosystem to automate products, inventory, and orders."**
    
2.  **Integration Diagram Implementation**:
    *   Replaced the static screenshot image with a **custom coded CSS/SVG diagram**.
    *   This replicates the "triangle" concept from your uploaded image:
        *   **Top Node**: ACC (Avetti Channel Connect).
        *   **Left Node**: Your Shopify Store (Green Bag Icon).
        *   **Right Node**: External Suppliers (Indigo Store Icon).
    *   **Benefits**:
        *   **Transparent Background**: Fits perfectly on the gradient background.
        *   **Theme Blending**: Uses the exact colors from your design system (Blue, Green, Indigo).
        *   **Scalable**: Looks sharp on all screen sizes.

## Next Steps

The changes are now live in your local development environment. Since the diagram is code-based, you can easily tweak the text or colors directly in `HeroSection.tsx` if needed.
