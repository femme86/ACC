# Walkthrough - Hero Section Reverted Text

I have reverted the text content of the Hero Section while keeping the new integration diagram.

## Changes Made

1.  **Text & Layout (Reverted)**:
    *   **Title**: Reverted to **"10x Your Shopify Sales"**.
    *   **Subtext**: Reverted to **"Add Suppliers on Shopify to grow Your Shopify/Shopify Plus Catalog..."**
    *   **Left Section Layout**: Restored to the original layout.

2.  **Integration Diagram (Kept)**:
    *   The **new CSS/SVG diagram** remains on the right side.
    *   It continues to use the project's color scheme (Blue, Green, Indigo) and sits on the transparent background.

## Visual Verification

Here is the updated Hero Section with the original text and the new diagram:

## Next Steps

The application is running with these changes. You can verify them at `http://localhost:5173/`.
